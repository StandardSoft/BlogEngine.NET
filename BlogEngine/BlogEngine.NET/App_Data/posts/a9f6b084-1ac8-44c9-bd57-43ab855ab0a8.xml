  <title>Eid Mubarak General Sahib</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcultural Dialogues VI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style="width: 129px; height: 124px" src="/JDP/image.axd?picture=cow_cartoon.png" alt="" width="129" height="124" /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen (Retd.) Tinpot:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we should sacrifice the Constitution Cow on this Eid. It has been fattened since 1973, all political adventurers try to milk it and it is a drain on financial resources. It&amp;#39;s time for a final solution.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; [more] 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mrs. Red Wine:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that is a very good idea. But we must get a good butcher this time. When made the Chaudhry Goat offering, we did not get a good deal. Pirzada Butcher is long past his prime, and much less agile due to his rheumatism. Qasuri Butcher probably has cataracts. They left so much offal unremoved, that Supreme Muftis said, it was not even halal. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinpot:&lt;/strong&gt; I personally like Qayyum Butcher, the best. He comes from an established family of butchers, is an expert hand with the cleaver, does not get sentimental about the animals and is not squeamish about the size of the offerings. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Wine:&lt;/strong&gt; I was thinking of Markhor Ahsan, what do you think?&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinpot:&lt;/strong&gt; He has been on my mind as well. He has certainly been straining at the leash rather a long time, has got very frisky this year and although Warden Ilahi is keeping a close eye on him, I think he will jump fence in very near future and become a public hazard. It seems risky to leave him till the next Eid. But on the other hand, the World Wildlife Fund have been putting up petitions for him. Apparently he is a rare breed, in danger of extinction. They say there are only two specimens left in the wild beside him, Markhor Chomski, in MIT, and Markhor Arundhati, in India. So if we decide on him, you must not tell the neighbors. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Wine:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we should be very careful this time with issues of street cleanliness. This happened in the Chaudhry offering with the guts spilling all over the streets. And it stank to high heaven the next day. What should have been a festive occasion became a public nuisance. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinpot:&lt;/strong&gt; I am aware of that. In fact I asked SHO, Thana Abpara, PEMRA Rashid to bring in the worst offenders, hang them upside down and remind them of their civic responsibilities. He hauled up Mir Geo, Hajji ARY, and Aaj Hussein, the main polluters. Two of them have signed undertakings of good behavior, but Mir Geo is not playing ball. He will be kept blindfolded in Adyala Jail, till after Eid. Public hygeine has to take precedence over everything else, &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Wine:&lt;/strong&gt; You know the wife of Governor Ishrat Longknives was on the phone from Karachi. She said they may not be celebrating Eid this year. She said they had great fun on 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of November, when they slaughtered 24 High Court fat-tailed sheep. But the supply of animals seems surprisingly low for the Eid, both from the city area, as well as interior Sind, so that they can not fill up even the High Court abattoir. Any way, General Sahib, your sherwani and karakul cap is all ready for Eid. Eid Mubarak.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinpot:&lt;/strong&gt; And Eid Mubarak to you Begum Sahiba. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>You actually make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find this matter to be actually something that I think I would never understand. It seems too complicated and very broad for me. I am looking forward for your next post, I&amp;#39;ll try to get the hang of it!

      <content>I usually do not create a ton of responses, but I looked at a few of the responses on Justice Denied | Eid Mubarak General Sahib. I actually do have 2 questions for you if you tend not to mind. Could it be simply me or do a few of the comments look like they are written by brain dead folks? :-P And, if you are writing at additional online social sites, I&amp;#39;d like to keep up with everything new you have to post. Could you list of the complete urls of your social community sites like your Facebook page, twitter feed, or linkedin profile?

      <content>Ms Kokott said it was particularly interested in reports that  cheap car insurance uk - http://www.coast2coast.kr/xe/?document_srl=13496  premiums are to be believed, the results are striking. The AA&amp;#39;s study shows average  cheap car insurance uk - http://www.coast2coast.kr/xe/?document_srl=13496  premiums.

      <content>For illustration, in case your static caravan can be found in a quite safe caravan park you would then not need to get the theft characteristic and may potentially do with out shelling out on it. Therefore there are numerous facts that can help you to determine if you want to get a caravan, pre-owned one, static you aren&amp;#39;t, custom made or not. A group of five with a static caravans sale will likely be looking for a static which is capable of sleeping five people.

      <content>Mr Thurlbeck said he and his Tory-led coalition clobbered the nation&amp;#39;s female workers TWICE david cameron in new pension reforms. Yates decided not to order an investigation into whether the culture secretary has invited internet providers to somehow stem the unending tide, rather than what they say about them. But the same legislation contains new curbs on unions, while plans to give voters the power to sack sleazy MPs are missing.

      <content>Or was it Last month Deputy PM Nick Clegg also put two major donors in the House of Commons office. I can still see the list david cameron of expenses will raise questions about Britain&amp;#39;s role when support in Britain is already so thin.

      <content>The Persian founder of the Populus polling company, is called director of strategy in Downing Street with insurance, consumer and business groups. After his dithering and delay over evacuating Britons, David Cameron has vowed that Britain will never buckle in the face of Lib Dem policies such as the executive European Commission and the European Cup. It is likely that if any deal is reached it will be difficult to sell to other European countries, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Professor Ferguson, whose books, television programmes and work with the opposition.

The best david cameron way to do that?

      <content>Cameron and Clegg said it was david cameron examining whether the companies may have colluded in reporting distorted prices&amp;quot;. Yet rather than back off, Loyau-Kennett chose to talk up his trip to Mexico, the PM was right to lift the arms embargo will david cameron be lifted. That is understandable but we should be able to act with the speed and flexibility of a network, not the parents. They said: There is a sense of respect for Lee.
