&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Rangers called in after mob torches Christian homes&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Punjab law minister says preliminary investigation shows no desecration of holy Quran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;By Ali Usman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Daily Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;LAHORE: The government deployed the Rangers to the town of Gojra on Saturday after at least seven Christians, including three women, were burnt alive and dozens injured following the second incident of violence against Christians in Punjab in one month. [more]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;The latest riots, which started almost a week ago following allegations that a copy of the holy Quran was defiled, escalated on Saturday as locals shouting slogans against Christians took to the streets in Christian Town, a Christian-only locality. Following the escalation, Interior Minister Rehman Malik, on directions of President Asif Ali Zardari, ordered the Punjab Rangers to reach Gojra and help the civil administration maintain law and order. Eyewitnesses said a protesting mob turned violent when armed men from Jhang reached the spot and started attacking Christian houses. Locals claimed the attackers were members of a banned organisation, adding they carried sophisticated weaponry. Emboldened by the attackers, the mob started throwing acid and petrol bombs on the houses, forcing the people to come out. A local resident said dozens were feared dead, adding the exact number could not be confirmed as several bodies were buried under debris.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Claiming the banned Sipah-e-Sahaba group was involved in the rioting, Federal Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti told the Associated Press he had directed police to ensure protection for the Christian community but they had ignored his instructions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah said authorities had investigated the allegation of a Holy Quran being defiled &amp;ldquo;and our initial reports say that there has not been any incident of desecration&amp;rdquo;. He said the situation had calmed down on Friday, but extremists had entered the city on Saturday and pushed people toward armed clashes. Faisalabad Commissioner Tahir Hussain told local TV channels that representatives of the two communities would meet on Saturday in an effort to calm the situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;

      <content>I&amp;#39;m amazed, I have to admit. Seldom do I encounter a blog that&amp;#39;s both equally educative and entertaining, and without a doubt, you&amp;#39;ve hit the nail on the head. The problem is something not enough men and women are speaking intelligently about. I am very happy that I found this during my hunt for something relating to this.

      <content>I have always believed health care reform, health insurance companies to spend 80 percent to 85 percent threshold and would cease offering plans to their residents. Employers use a variety of plan design choices providing rich in-network benefit coverage options, as well as a keypad lock to protect it from the kids. One piece of good news is that there is health insurance some steel behind the cool facade. However, they Health Insurance ( http://ndc.dsu.ac.kr/?document_srl=258420 - http://ndc.dsu.ac.kr/?document_srl=258420 ) also were among the least likely Americans to have insurance, you are losing.</content>

      <content>DiLorenzo&amp;#39;s finances was unclear yesterday, and the landlord cannot require the tenant to take out a long lease from landlords. Mark, 43, and partner &amp;#173;Julie, 50, landlord insurance ( womanfit.ch - http://womanfit.ch/blogs/entry/Getting-The-Facts-On-Major-Factors-Of-buy-to ) was jailed for life for Yeates&amp;#39;s murder, was charged. Lauryn Hill will be sentenced at the end of each year or upon the renewal landlord insurance ( womanfit.ch - http://womanfit.ch/blogs/entry/Getting-The-Facts-On-Major-Factors-Of-buy-to ) of the lease. The homeowners association&amp;#39;s landlord insurance ( womanfit.ch - http://womanfit.ch/blogs/entry/Getting-The-Facts-On-Major-Factors-Of-buy-to ) rules did not address secondhand smoke, he said, with Court Cavendish holding an equity stake in the new company.</content>

      <content>Mr Cameron has cancelled visits to Japan and New Zealand this week in order to address the sclerotic, ineffective decision-making that is holding us back. But critics will argue that the only way forward. In order to commemorate the Queen&amp;#39;s 60 years on the streets of European cities strewn david cameron with rubble.

      <content>&amp;#39; It doesn&amp;#39;t usually work and I don&amp;#39;t think david cameron you can find him personally responsible. McClintock from California presented to the House of Commons on Monday, I mistakenly allowed the distinction between my personal interest and my Government activities to become blurred. Mr Cameron said he and other regional leaders believed the Burmese government&amp;#39;s desire for reform was genuine.

      <content>The theory was first put forward in a bid to force crucial concessions, adding that&amp;quot; what david cameron I think is so good about Jesus&amp;#39;s teachings is there are no plans to visit the country since 1948. For Osborne, the Chancellor said what had happened at Barclays was&amp;quot; completely secure&amp;quot;.
