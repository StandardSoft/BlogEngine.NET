&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Recent events in Pakistan show that our worst fears may have been correct and musharraf and his agents in Karachi (or is it the other way round?) will not allow any peaceful transition to democracy. (some people may prefer to frame this as &amp;quot;Pakistanis in general are not ready for democracy&amp;quot;., but considering the mess the army has made in 50 years of army rule, its not clear how all pakistanis or &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; can be blamed equally for this mess). Imagine, if the establishment had quietly accepted the results of the last polls, what would we have seen? New governments would have been in place by now. PPP in Sindh, PPP led coalitions in Federal and Balochistan, PMLN led coalition in Punjab and ANP led coalition in Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;[more] 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;The judges would have been restored immediately, starting the process of rule of law for the first time in our history. A great honeymoon feeling would have pervaded the country. MQM could have been made to accept results (no other choice being &amp;nbsp;immediately visible) or they would have been the sole disruptors and would have faced the wrath of a united country. The jihadist problem would have remained, but its never been big enough to stop the country from working ..and so on. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;But, that has not happened. Army house has continued its conspiracies, the atmosphere has been thoroughly vitiated. Now MQM is emboldened to act on Musharraf&amp;#39;s behalf because PPP has already shown that it is not averse to deal making... thus encouraging the old corruptocracy to think that only PMLN and the lawyers have to be knocked out and things will be &amp;quot;back to normal&amp;quot;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Karachi is held hostage. Kiyani sahib is rehearsing his speech and being a wise man, is waiting till the dish is fully cooked. We could easily go from bad to worse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Pakistan had a very small window of opportunity to repair the damage of decades of military rule. But the refusal of the army or Musharraf to read the writing on the wall means this opportunity may soon be lost. When and IF that happens, matters are likely to become very very violent as ifferent groups try to establish or hold power in different areas. In such anarchy, the Sindhis are not going to get much unless they can organize very quickly. As things stand, they cannot match the MQM in Urban Sindh and are likely to be colonized further if the legal order completely breaks down. But i dont see how even the army will hold everything together? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;The new mood in Punjab is such that I see no possibility of quiet acceptance of further rule by MQM-supported generals. Kiyani sahib may yet get a short honeymoon, but if he continues to use the MQM and Q-league as the main civilian agents, then how will he make it work where musharraf could not? Pakistan may be headed for much more &amp;nbsp;violent sorting out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;comments?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Omar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <content>I&amp;#39;m impressed, I must say. Rarely do I come across a blog that&amp;#39;s both equally educative and engaging, and let me tell you, you&amp;#39;ve hit the nail on the head. The problem is something too few men and women are speaking intelligently about. Now i&amp;#39;m very happy that I stumbled across this during my search for something concerning this.

      <content>I tend not to leave a ton of responses, but i did some searching and wound up here Justice Denied | The Downward Spiral. And I do have a couple of questions for you if it&amp;#39;s allright. Is it just me or does it seem like some of the responses look like they are coming from brain dead visitors? :-P And, if you are posting at other online social sites, I&amp;#39;d like to keep up with everything new you have to post. Could you make a list of the complete urls of your shared pages like your linkedin profile, Facebook page or twitter feed?

      <content>Hey there! I realize this is sort of off-topic but I needed to ask. Does operating a well-established blog such as yours require a lot of work? I&amp;#39;m brand new to blogging however I do write in my diary everyday. I&amp;#39;d like to start a blog so I will be able to share my personal experience and feelings online. Please let me know if you have any kind of suggestions or tips for new aspiring bloggers. Thankyou!

      <content>Everything said made a ton of sense. But, what about this? what if you typed a catchier post title? I ain&amp;#39;t saying your information is not good, but what if you added a title to maybe grab folk&amp;#39;s attention? I mean Justice Denied | The Downward Spiral is a little plain. You ought to glance at Yahoo&amp;#39;s front page and watch how they create post titles to get people to open the links. You might add a video or a related pic or two to grab people interested about everything&amp;#39;ve written. In my opinion, it could make your posts a little livelier.
