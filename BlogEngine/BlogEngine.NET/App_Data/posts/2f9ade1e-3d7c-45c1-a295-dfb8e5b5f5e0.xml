Being the head of our great country I do realise that your duties which we all know that come before all and sundry even family takes you far and wide to meet with your humble and loyal subjects.

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The problems are so many that even many a page wont be able to sum them up starting from lack of drinking water to say hostile neighbours. Ma&amp;rsquo;am must be very concerned and I wonder who is briefing her on this delicate and non-understandable issue. Anyway even Sir Humphrey Appleby of yes minister/prime minister fame will fail it straightaway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;I will go back in time to circa January 1983 on a cold Friday night on the bus route number 4 from Samanabad (A locality in Lahore) to Lahore railway station made famous in the Bhawani Junction where my late father used to pitch up to see Eva Gardner. Well after all, apart from being my father he was a man as well and who can blame him for being Eva&amp;rsquo;s fan. He must have envied Frank Sinatra though he was more handsome than him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;Anyway I boarded the bus from the &lt;em&gt;mor&lt;/em&gt; or &amp;lsquo;Turn Samanabad&amp;rsquo;, promptly sat in the back seat and obediently paid 25 paisa as my student fare. There were few passengers and the conductor (A relic of the past in GB) after dutifully picking up fares sauntered towards me and wondered if he could sit next to me. Off course I had no objection. He confirmed with me if I were at King Edward Medical College (named after Great Grandpa Edward 7th). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;He went on to remind me that I was only to get a student fair on showing my pass to which I agreed; but being and looking like( I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he diagnosed that) a medical student and that to of Grandpa&amp;rsquo;s school, he did not feel it was necessary. He then drew a long sigh and commented on the unfortunate ways of the &amp;lsquo;so called students&amp;rsquo; and if I correctly remember he addressed us as &amp;lsquo;the cream of the nation and builders of tomorrow&amp;rsquo; the fortunate ones who instead of studying were more interested in fights, disobeying law, coercion, eve teasing and anything bad that one can think off. But the students of your school are like angels, well behaved, always give the fare, polite and law abiding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;I, off course, was on cloud nine and then he added the prophecy which is true of the situation which afflicts Pakistan today. He said and now keep in mind that he was a poor bus conductor, probably not even O levels qualified &amp;ldquo;If these are our leaders/builders of the nation then God have mercy on our future&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;To be honest Ma&amp;rsquo;am, I did not understand the gravity of what he had just said. It would only become apparent to me 20 years later and now I think how true he was. Pakistan in medical parlance and terminology at birth had loads of passive immunity from the masters from the mother country. When the umbilical cord was severed, it did well for sometime but failed to develop any active immunity to prevent it being afflicted from the maladies that we see today. It&amp;rsquo;s just that we have failed to educate ourselves in more ways than one!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"&gt;Yours truly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>My programmer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP. I have always disliked the idea because of the costs. But he&amp;#39;s tryiong none the less. I&amp;#39;ve been using Movable-type on a number of websites for about a year and am concerned about switching to another platform. I have heard great things about blogengine.net. Is there a way I can import all my wordpress content into it? Any kind of help would be really appreciated!

      <content>Awesome blog! Do you have any recommendations for aspiring writers? I&amp;#39;m planning to start my own blog soon but I&amp;#39;m a little lost on everything. Would you advise starting with a free platform like Wordpress or go for a paid option? There are so many choices out there that I&amp;#39;m completely confused .. Any recommendations? Bless you!

I&amp;#39;m getting fed up of Wordpress because I&amp;#39;ve had issues with hackers and I&amp;#39;m looking at options for another platform.

Six months ago I was banned from driving after he lost control driving conviction of his mother&amp;#39;s Fiat Seicento close to the access gates to the Corus steelworks on the Stocksbridge bypass.
