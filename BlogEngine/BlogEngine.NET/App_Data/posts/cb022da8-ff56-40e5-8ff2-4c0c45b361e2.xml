  <title>The Surge and the Purge</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;Transcultural Dialogues IV&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style="width: 122px; height: 137px" src="/JDP/image.axd?picture=chaudhary.jpg" alt="" width="122" height="137" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img style="width: 126px; height: 137px" src="/JDP/image.axd?picture=perveiz+chaudry.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="137" /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaudhry Mumble Hussein: &lt;/strong&gt;Good news, the preparations for the International Bootlicker&amp;rsquo;s Conference are now complete, we had positive confirmation so far from the brother republics of Burma and Congo, do you have any special guests?&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaudhry Ambition Ilahi: &lt;/strong&gt;I have just been to see General Shiny Boots Kiyani.[more]&lt;font face="Verdana"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;I have to see I have seldom come across with someone, with such deep&amp;nbsp; understanding of&amp;nbsp; national and international affairs, and we discussed issues such as Unity of Command, which is of&amp;nbsp; utmost importance at this critical juncture of our history. I told&amp;nbsp; him that the people expect him to his national duty, and take over the administration as president, if things do not&amp;nbsp; improve rapidly. We will support him 10 times or more, as long as&amp;nbsp; he is in uniform. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ch. Mumble: &lt;/strong&gt;Whilst you have been breathing the GHQ air, we had some difficulty in dealing with some American Taliban infiltrators, with the code name of Codepink. They were trying to join the Al-Qaeda chapter that Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, is operating from Aitazaz Ahsan&amp;rsquo;s residence. I&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; am pleased though, that our Elite Force have acquitted themselves with honour, they sprang on them after tracking them down with the satellite positioning, and surveillance drones, and put them on the flight to the JFK, before they could say 58-2b. Mr. Hunt says, they will feel the full force of justice under the Patriot Act for their anti-American activities.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ch. Ambition: &lt;/strong&gt;I discussed the regional perspective with Shiny Boots, he mentioned a technique called &amp;lsquo;Surge&amp;rsquo; which has brought things under control in Sadr City, in Baghdad. The army units go in, destroy the enemy and then stay in to protect the local residents, and prevent return of insurgents. Shiny boots&amp;nbsp; said that they have employed a similar technique, called the&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Purge&amp;rsquo;, our crack commandos go to the Supreme Court, liquidate the nasty judges, and they stay on to give confidence to the peace loving judges, so that they can give unbiased decisions, without fear or favour.. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ch. Mumble: &lt;/strong&gt;I agree, this may be a good&amp;nbsp; policy at the provincial level as&amp;nbsp; well, although the dangerous&amp;nbsp; judges are still&amp;nbsp; holed&amp;nbsp; up in their residences, which will&amp;nbsp; have to be liberated from their occupation, by sustained and steadfast military action. I am pleased though that the new judges in support of democracy have used their powers to authorize actions against the reckless arsonists, who disguise themselves by holding candle-lit vigils outside these residences. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ch. Ambition: &lt;/strong&gt;Actually I have met with Mrs. Patterson as well. She assured me that her Government is in complete support of the electoral process and is impressed with the desire and courage of the Pakistani people, who have made great sacrifices for democracy. To promote democracy, she has offered assistance to raise the standards of Attock and Mianwali to the level of Abu Gharaib and Bagram. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ch. Mumble: &lt;/strong&gt;I think with such good governance, we are justified in going to the electorate and ask for their votes on the basis of our performance. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <content>Superb blog! Do you have any hints for aspiring writers? I&amp;#39;m planning to start my own blog soon but I&amp;#39;m a little lost on everything. Would you propose starting with a free platform like Wordpress or go for a paid option? There are so many choices out there that I&amp;#39;m completely confused .. Any ideas? Kudos!

      <content>I do not know if it&amp;#39;s just me or if perhaps everyone else experiencing issues with your blog. It appears as if some of the text within your posts are running off the screen. Can somebody else please provide feedback and let me know if this is happening to them as well? This could be a problem with my internet browser because I&amp;#39;ve had this happen before. Appreciate it

      <content>I hardly drop remarks, but after looking at a few of the comments on this page Justice Denied | The Surge and the Purge. I actually do have some questions for you if you don&amp;#39;t mind. Could it be simply me or does it seem like some of these responses come across as if they are written by brain dead visitors? :-P And, if you are writing at other places, I&amp;#39;d like to keep up with everything new you have to post. Could you post a list of every one of all your public pages like your twitter feed, Facebook page or linkedin profile?

      <content>A Tory MP has said David Cameron apologised for the times when &amp;#39;America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive&amp;#39; towards its allies.
