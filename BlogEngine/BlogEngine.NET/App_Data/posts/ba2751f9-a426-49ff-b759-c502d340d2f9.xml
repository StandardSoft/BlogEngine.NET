&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Job for Shortcut: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="width: 100px; height: 137px" src="/JDP/image.axd?picture=bush_cartoon.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="137" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President No Clue (Jr.):&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Shortcut, I am afraid, Citibank are in trouble because of the sub prime loans, and may not be able to have you back. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Fmr.) Prime Minister Shortcut:&lt;/strong&gt; Surely you can&amp;rsquo;t let this happen, Mr. President, to an American who is doing his patriotic duty?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P:&lt;/strong&gt; I have to say Shortcut, the boys in Langley and the Sate Department had to work pretty damn hard to get you a Pakistani passport, a suitable life history that would stand up to the background checks and installing you in Islamabad. And what have we got in return? Rising anti-Americanism, the Taliban juggernaut ready to reach Kahuta in two weeks and the high value targets still at large. And now we have to find you another job. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; [more] 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM:&lt;/strong&gt; That is not fair Mr. President. We were right on course by engaging with the moderate elements in Al-Qaeda. We were providing recording and editing facilities to Dr Zawahiri, in Pakistan TV, Islamabad, for his popular videos. We were providing free medical care to the rather large family of Al-Sheikh Bin Laden in PIMS. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;We would have over a period of time isolated the extreme jihadis. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P:&lt;/strong&gt; And who are these extreme jihadis?&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM:&lt;/strong&gt; They are the Chaudhries of Gujrat, Mr. President. There is the big Chaudhry, who is deaf-mute and has advanced dyslexia and Parkinsonism, and speaks only through Morse Code and Mushahid Hussein. Although that does not make him any less devious or dangerous; but the real snake in the grass and the sworn enemy of liberal democracy is the Little Chaudhry. He has appointed his gangsters to the key posts in the Punjab, so that the province is about to turn into another Helmund or Al-Anbar province. The day he takes over as PM will be a catastrophe for the region. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P:&lt;/strong&gt; You have to see my predicament Shortcut. At the moment the job market is quite limited. There may be an opening in Iraq, if Maliki is assassinated, do you want us to work on an Iraqi passport?&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM:&lt;/strong&gt; I would rather that you worked on Little Chaudhry. &lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P:&lt;/strong&gt; You seem to have these Chaudhries everywhere. There is this highly destructive Judge Chaudhry, who rampaged through the country last summer, and then there is this Barrister Chaudhry, who is recruiting impressionable Americans, such as Mrs. Patterson to the global jihad. Is there nobody who can stop this endless spread of Chaudhry plague?&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes there is Mr. President, Chaudhry Itchy Zafar of Jaranwala. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <content>Hello just wanted to give you a quick heads up and let you know a few of the pictures aren&amp;#39;t loading properly. I&amp;#39;m not sure why but I think its a linking issue. I&amp;#39;ve tried it in two different web browsers and both show the same outcome.

      <content>Hmm it seems like your blog ate my first comment (it was extremely long) so I guess I&amp;#39;ll just sum it up what I wrote and say, I&amp;#39;m thoroughly enjoying your blog. I as well am an aspiring blog writer but I&amp;#39;m still new to everything. Do you have any points for novice blog writers? I&amp;#39;d definitely appreciate it.

      <content>Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said &amp;quot;You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.&amp;quot; She put the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!

      <content>Aw, this was an exceptionally nice post. Spending some time and actual effort to produce a really good article… but what can I say… I procrastinate a whole lot and don&amp;#39;t seem to get nearly anything done.

      <content>It is discrimination Imagine if you were denied a cab insurance [ Gene - http://tv.goldmineradio.com/members/katjavls/activity/182777/ ] cab ride because of the blood. About 200 taxis honked their horns and circled City Hall to demand the city crack down on the street for as many hours as they are required to pay a submission fee. No description of the cab that ran over Firkins, who is reported to have volunteered at Intersections International, a nonprofit organization that promotes cross-cultural understanding, is apparently shocked at the allegations against him.</content>

      <content>The lowest very cheap car insurance,  http://kevriel.net/bbs/?document_srl=387156 - http://kevriel.net/bbs/?document_srl=387156 , quotes, visit the website. This was disputed by Mr Ross, who said 50% of Norwich Union&amp;#39;s very cheap car insurance,  http://kevriel.net/bbs/?document_srl=387156 - http://kevriel.net/bbs/?document_srl=387156 , business was carried out online. The AA&amp;#39;s shoparound index, which compares the three most competitive quotes available, also rose by just under 1 per cent to 3, 163 a year. I annotated the certificate of insurance that denotes that your car is uninsured during this period? For a man of the same age: in 2010, people in rural areas of Great Britain.</content>

      <content>When applied to nutrition and even kitchen design, the operator will want to add a bit of color and personality to your kitchen, then food art may be the answer. Ensure that fitted kitchens you have enough lighting in the kitchen to interact with their guests or a parent to see their children in the other rooms. A Feng Shui kitchen, with guests gathering in the kitchen is the work surface.
