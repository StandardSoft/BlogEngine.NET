&lt;img style="width: 330px; height: 273px" src="/JDP/image.axd?picture=joseph_coat.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="273" /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Extraordinary Rendition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;By &lt;em&gt;Hakim Hazik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;The chairman of the CBR, Mr Abdullah Yusuf has described as preposterous the allegations by some philistines that his electrifying dance performance was motivated by intoxication, ambition, debauchery or pinworms. [more] &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;He emphasized that the said performance was undertaken in the line of duty; to create fiscal space for the cash strapped economy, to broaden the national base of direct taxes, and to reduce the burgeoning current account deficit. This performance was also Sharia compliant, as is the case with other financial instruments introduced by the Government. His detractors have warned that rather than creating fiscal space, his performance has dug a hole for the economy. But they are unpatriotic miscreants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;He pointed out that his presentation was part of a standard operative procedure and has been undertaken in various government departments, home and abroad. He reminded the audience of the internationally acclaimed musical, &amp;lsquo;The Deal&amp;rsquo;, which was painstakingly choreographed in minute detail, by the world famous conductor and director, Mr. Negroponte. This musical chronicles the progress of the mating dance that took place between the leadership of the PPP and the government of Gen. Tinpot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Mr Negroponte already has in his repertoire, record breaking productions, such as &amp;lsquo;Phantom of Honduras&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Jesus Christ, Guatemala&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Thoroughly Modern Iraq&amp;rsquo;. This skilful director does not shy away from explicit and turbulent scenes in his productions and many of his main protagonists often meet tragic ends, as indeed was the case in &amp;lsquo;The Deal&amp;rsquo;. The outcome however helped to create political space in Pakistan, where democracy could flourish. There are people who say that it has actually created a vacuum, to allow the political opportunists to cash in . But they are miscreants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Mr Yusuf&amp;rsquo;s performance has invoked various responses, in artistic and literary circles. The narrative of his performance itself is very evocative. It describes a tryst between two lovers on a canal bridge. One of them does not live up to his promise, calling his previous ardour, a &amp;lsquo;political statement&amp;rsquo;. The theme song is full of anguish and yearning and eventually of dejection and heartbreak. Some say that it reeks of cheap sentimentality, but then they are miscreants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;It has also caused the metaphysical question to be asked, &amp;lsquo;how many tax collectors can dance on the point of a needle?&amp;rsquo; (without necessitating securitisation of the public debt). It is unlikely that this debate will end anytime soon. Meanwhile, Mr Yusuf has received lucrative offers from the West End, Royal Dance Academy, Kirov Ballet and Sangeet Natak Academy. The Central Board of Revenue is studying the offers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;See also:&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYqi6shWyM&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;&lt;font color="#800080"&gt;Chairman CBR&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"&gt;Also by Hakim Hazik: &lt;a href="/post/2008/05/King-Badar-the-Conquerer.aspx"&gt;&lt;font color="#800080"&gt;King Badar the Conquerer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/post/2008/05/The-Marsupial-Nation.aspx"&gt;&lt;font color="#800080"&gt;The Marsupial Nation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/post/2008/03/Chaudhry-Negroponte.aspx"&gt;&lt;font color="#800080"&gt;Chaudhry Negroponte&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 9pt"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <content>Howdy just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The text in your article seem to be running off the screen in Safari. I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is a format issue or something to do with web browser compatibility but I figured I&amp;#39;d post to let you know. The layout look great though! Hope you get the problem fixed soon. Kudos

      <content>Greetings! I know this is kinda off topic but I was wondering which blog platform are you using for this website? I&amp;#39;m getting tired of Wordpress because I&amp;#39;ve had issues with hackers and I&amp;#39;m looking at alternatives for another platform. I would be great if you could point me in the direction of a good platform.

      <content>I leave a response when I appreciate a post on a site or if I have something to add to the discussion. Usually it is a result of the fire displayed in the post I browsed. And after this article Justice Denied | Yusuf And The Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat. I was excited enough to post a commenta response ;) I do have a couple of questions for you if you do not mind. Could it be simply me or do a few of the comments appear as if they are written by brain dead individuals? :-P And, if you are writing at other social sites, I&amp;#39;d like to keep up with you. Could you make a list every one of your communal sites like your Facebook page, twitter feed, or linkedin profile?

      <content>Job hunters can also setup their very own account, upload their resume, and setup notifications. The three basic colors used by reproduction are cyan, magenta and yellow.  It was foreseen the amount of 3D printers in homes and business establishments increase rapidly.</content>

      <content>I know this if off topic but I&amp;#39;m looking into starting my own blog and was curious what all is needed to get setup? I&amp;#39;m assuming having a blog like yours would cost a pretty penny? I&amp;#39;m not very web smart so I&amp;#39;m not 100% positive. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks</content>

      <content>What i don&amp;#39;t realize is in reality how you&amp;#39;re no longer really a lot more well-liked than you may be now. You&amp;#39;re very intelligent. You realize thus significantly when it comes to this subject, made me in my view imagine it from so many varied angles. Its like women and men are not interested until it is one thing to accomplish with Lady gaga! Your personal stuffs great. Always deal with it up!</content>
