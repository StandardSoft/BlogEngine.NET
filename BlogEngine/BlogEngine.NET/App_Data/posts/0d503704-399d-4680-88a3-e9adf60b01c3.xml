      <content>Hi would you mind letting me know which hosting company you&amp;#39;re using? I&amp;#39;ve loaded your blog in 3 completely different browsers and I must say this blog loads a lot quicker then most. Can you suggest a good internet hosting provider at a honest price? Cheers, I appreciate it!
