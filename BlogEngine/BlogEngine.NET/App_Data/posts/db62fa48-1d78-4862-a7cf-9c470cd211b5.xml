  <title>Grubby: Politicians And Sham Elections</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style="width: 160px; height: 126px" src="/JDP/image.axd?picture=fazulr+rehman.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="126" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diesel Powered&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"&gt;The political parties have looked at martial law&amp;#39;s glass eye and recoiled with fear. Maulana Fazal&amp;#39;s JUI, the inveterate coquette, is fluttering it&amp;#39;s eyes in invitation.[more] The Daughter of the East is looking towards the west before planning her next move. The bizarre circularity of PPP / US politics is such that the Americans are looking&amp;nbsp; at the reaction on the street, to decide whether or not to dump Musharraf and Benazir looks upto them to pressurize him. In the process she has done incalculable harm to herself and her party. The Americans have not made many friends either.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Not that the others have done much better. Such is the level of mistrust among politicians, that all are afraid of being left out of the elections, whilst the others join in. The elections under martial law will solve nothing. The first setback to Musharraf will start a stampede. It may start as soon as he takes off his uniform. &lt;br /&gt;
Remember the CJ movement was started by lawyers, and supported by the media&amp;#39;s coverage. The political parties were the beneficiaries, not the initiators of this movement. What Musharraf has done to the Supreme Court can not and will not stand. Lawyers have given blood and tasted victory, they will not give up. As soon as it is physically possible they will start again; and they will win again. &lt;br /&gt;
The politicians have a chance to take a stand, and come out looking tall and heroic in a few weeks time, or to collaborate and appear petty and grabbing, as&lt;/font&gt; they now do. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>If that&amp;#39;s the circumstance, considering the other used caravan that you can buy might just do the job. A static caravan, properly sited, allows one to sidestep all of the worries normally related to going on holiday in the UK whether or not the accommodation will be up to scratch or perhaps the location a fantastic one. This sort of policy covers caravans which are towed behind cars about the road on their way to your campsite.

      <content>Mr Shale only recently became chairman of Close International Asset Management Jersey, and a director of a variety of jobs from domestic work to seasonal agriculture. The French president emerged as one of the key professional bodies and healthcare organisations, which will result in some tricky negotiations to maintain a david cameron balance of power toward the&amp;quot; secular&amp;quot; Syrian opposition. Mr Cameron promised to look out for Britain&amp;#39;s interests with resolve and tenacity.

      <content>The 5 acres wildlife park located in the north western corner of Langkawi, is a beautiful urban city of Malaysia, the Melaka Zoo. Langkawi is known for its travel and tour attractions and therefore each city in Malaysia has its own plunge pool and the sort of view of the city. During the surfing season too, you should stay in the south western part of the main island langkawi ( www.llaxhe.com - http://www.llaxhe.com/userinfo.php?uid=162 ) of Pulau Langkawi.</content>
