&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Resign Musharraf, Resign! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By JEMIMA KHAN 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[more] 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(InformPress.com) - I am now a serial protester, it seems. And among&lt;br /&gt;
my English friends increasingly the butt of jokes. Three&lt;br /&gt;
demonstrations in the UK since October, and several others - including&lt;br /&gt;
some of a distinctly Monty Python-esque bent - during my years of&lt;br /&gt;
living in Pakistan. I have spent many a pre-protest evening in&lt;br /&gt;
Islamabad quibbling with activists over the minutiae: what the&lt;br /&gt;
placards should say (no &amp;quot;death to...&amp;quot; anyone, I would insist) or whether&lt;br /&gt;
to allow effigy burning, a Pakistani protest staple (&amp;quot;Jem, you don&amp;#39;t&lt;br /&gt;
understand how politics works here - please, just a burning Bush&amp;quot;). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow at midday I will once again be positioning myself outside 10&lt;br /&gt;
Downing Street, to await the arrival of retired General and self-&lt;br /&gt;
appointed President Pervez Musharraf, who I intend to greet with lusty&lt;br /&gt;
jeers, provocative placards and slogans that almost rhyme. We have&lt;br /&gt;
agreed that we don&amp;#39;t like the commonly used kuta, meaning dog. Monkey,&lt;br /&gt;
fox, hyena and, worst of all (for a pork-phobic nation), swine have&lt;br /&gt;
also been banned. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I expect most of you will be thinking: &amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t demonstrations a bit&lt;br /&gt;
old fashioned and irrelevant? Can they actually achieve anything?&amp;quot; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is 40 years since 1968, &amp;quot;The Year That Rocked The World&amp;quot;, when mass&lt;br /&gt;
protests erupted across the globe, in France, America, Mexico,&lt;br /&gt;
Germany, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Belgium, Poland, Yugoslavia and&lt;br /&gt;
Czechoslovakia. While none of those demonstrations achieved their&lt;br /&gt;
immediate stated aim, cumulatively they changed the world more&lt;br /&gt;
profoundly than those involved could ever have imagined. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Popular protests rarely achieve much on their own. Hillary Clinton had&lt;br /&gt;
a point when she said that &amp;quot;[Martin Luther] King&amp;#39;s dream began to be&lt;br /&gt;
realised when U.S. President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights&lt;br /&gt;
Act of 1964. It took a President to get it done.&amp;quot; She was lambasted by&lt;br /&gt;
her Democratic rivals for having demeaned the great civil rights icon.&lt;br /&gt;
But she was right that, while there is no doubt King was brilliant at&lt;br /&gt;
mobilising a movement, as well as an outstanding orator and&lt;br /&gt;
inspirational activist, his real achievement was the shifting of&lt;br /&gt;
American consciousness. This created the environment in which it was&lt;br /&gt;
possible for Johnson to pass the humanitarian Civil Rights Act which&lt;br /&gt;
resulted in the greatest social change in 20th-century America. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The effects of protests are rarely immediate or even measurable. What&lt;br /&gt;
demonstrations do is to change the weather. And the weather changes&lt;br /&gt;
the landscape. Protests invariably move from the extreme to the&lt;br /&gt;
mainstream. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes, though, they really do what they say on the banners.&lt;br /&gt;
Ghandi&amp;#39;s march to the sea to make salt marked the beginning of the&lt;br /&gt;
push to remove the British from India; the Suffragettes did get the&lt;br /&gt;
vote for women; the Peasant&amp;#39;s Revolt did change the feudal system; and&lt;br /&gt;
the Anti-Slavery Movement did do away with slavery. They are all&lt;br /&gt;
examples of what demonstrations hope to achieve: the mass power of the&lt;br /&gt;
individually powerless. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow I will be protesting Gordon Brown&amp;#39;s continued support for&lt;br /&gt;
Pakistan&amp;#39;s dictator. I will be joined by politicians, lawyers,&lt;br /&gt;
doctors, human rights activists, journalists and ordinary Pakistanis&lt;br /&gt;
who want to know what happened to New Labour&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;ethical foreign&lt;br /&gt;
policy&amp;quot;. Our equivalents in Pakistan have been denied the same right&lt;br /&gt;
to protest. Many hundreds remain in prison - some tortured. We can&amp;#39;t&lt;br /&gt;
read about it because the media in Pakistan remains restricted. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Brown and Musharraf are planning to discuss democracy, counter-&lt;br /&gt;
terrorism and the upcoming Pakistani elections. We, the crowd outside&lt;br /&gt;
Number 10, will be there exercising freedom of speech and practising&lt;br /&gt;
real democracy. Inside they will only be going through the motions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How can they seriously discuss the &amp;quot;democratic process in Pakistan&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
with straight faces when 60 percent of the Superior Court judges have&lt;br /&gt;
been dismissed and many are still under house arrest? How can &amp;quot;free&lt;br /&gt;
and fair elections&amp;quot; take place in three weeks under the supervision of&lt;br /&gt;
hand-picked substitute judges, a pet caretaker government and a bogus&lt;br /&gt;
election Commission? Why is our Government supporting and our&lt;br /&gt;
taxpayers funding a counter-terrorism strategy that has encouraged&lt;br /&gt;
terrorism? Above all, why has our Prime Minister chosen to host a&lt;br /&gt;
constitutionally illegal ruler who has lost the support of Pakistanis&lt;br /&gt;
both in Britain and abroad, and who is seen as the cause not the&lt;br /&gt;
solution to the country&amp;#39;s problems? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every time Gordon Brown shakes hands with and gives tea to a dictator,&lt;br /&gt;
in some small way, like protests, it changes the weather. If you shake&lt;br /&gt;
hands with one, you shake hands with them all. It&amp;#39;s pointless refusing&lt;br /&gt;
to be in the same country as Mugabe, if you invite Musharraf into your&lt;br /&gt;
home. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be nice if, on hearing our shouts, Brown came to the&lt;br /&gt;
window of Number 10, waved cordially at the rabble outside and&lt;br /&gt;
announced: &amp;quot;Actually, you are right.&amp;quot; To be followed from within by&lt;br /&gt;
pleasing sounds of scuffle and outrage with Brown emerging to join our&lt;br /&gt;
final chorus of &amp;quot;Resign Musharraf, Resign!&amp;quot; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is more likely that we will just make ourselves heard. But who&lt;br /&gt;
knows? 2008 may yet turn out to be Pakistan&amp;#39;s 1968. Inshallah. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Monday, midday, Downing Street. Effigies supplied. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
